Both essays respond and address the question correctly. Good job!

I appreciated the pseudo-code you provided, it gives a nice touch of
elegance.

The DFA looks good.

You should use $\Sigma$ in your DFA. Lets say that you want to make
an arrow if the next symbol is not an 'f', you could simply say $\{\Sigma - f\}$,
which means the set of all possible symbols of the whole alphabet minus 'f'.
